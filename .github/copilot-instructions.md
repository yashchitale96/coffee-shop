# Coffee Shop Website

This is a modern, immersive landing page for a specialty coffee shop using:

- Vite + React for the frontend framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- GSAP for animations
- Three.js (via React Three Fiber) for 3D elements
- Framer Motion for scroll-based animations

The design is inspired by emergenceprojects.com with scroll-based animations, parallax effects, and 3D elements.

Key features:
- Scroll-triggered 3D coffee cup/bean model
- Animated sections that fade in as user scrolls
- Parallax effects and smooth transitions
- Modern, minimalist design with warm color palette (mocha brown, cream, charcoal)
- Elegant typography using serif and sans-serif fonts
